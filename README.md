# Age_prediction-Resnet50

Data was obtained from kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/mariafrenti/age-prediction 

There data contained age 1-100 people each age containing 350 to 400 images. These images were augmented and a regression model was developed using Resnet50. The model gave a good prediction over some ages and worked bad others. The main reason is that there wouldn't be huge difference over a range of ages say 21-25 or 30-40. Model gave a very good prediction on people of young age.
